# ownews (Distributed Social News)

## Overview
In this project, an algorithm was developed to build a social news website which used distributed logic as opposed to the centralised social news websites existent at the time in 2012. The distributed logic was used to bring out features like personalisation and self-moderation opening a pathway towards user-centric rather than community oriented social news. A web application was built to showcase the idea as part of the project using Java, Spring MVC, Hibernate, SQL, JSP, Javascript, Ajax, CSS.

The web application was developed using the Model-View-Controller(MVC)architecture which separates the business logic from the user interface logic. Spring MVC and Hibernate frameworks were used for this.
